Schema Design:
For the schema, we’ll need tables/entities to represent users, apartments, reviews, and helpful marks. 

Here’s a simplified example:

User: id, 
      username, 
      email, 
      password (hash)
      
Apartment:  id,
            name, 
            address,
            contact,
            amenities,
            etc.
Review: id,
        user_id,
        apartment_id,
        rating,
        comment,
        media_url,

HelpfulMark:id,
            review_id,
            user_id,
            helpful (boolean)
